Good point üëç
If the "vendor" is actually your current organization (your employer), then on your resume it‚Äôs clearer and more professional to write it that way instead of saying vendor. Recruiters might get confused if you mention vendor.

Here‚Äôs how you can word it:


---

Option 1 ‚Äì Separate Awards Section

Awards & Recognition

Spot Award ‚Äì Conferred by client for exceptional contribution to project success.

Certificate of Appreciation ‚Äì Presented by [Your Organization‚Äôs Name] in recognition of Spot Award achievement.



---

Option 2 ‚Äì Within Work Experience

Software Engineer | [Your Organization Name] | [Dates]

Received a Spot Award from client for outstanding contribution to project delivery.

Honored with a Certificate of Appreciation from [Your Organization Name] in recognition of the client award.



---

This way:

The client recognition (Spot Award) shows your direct impact on the project.

The organization recognition (Certificate) shows that your company values your contribution too.


üëâ So instead of saying vendor, always use ‚Äúorganization‚Äù or your company‚Äôs name on your resume.

Would you like me to draft a polished single-line bullet combining both, so it looks crisp on your resume?
